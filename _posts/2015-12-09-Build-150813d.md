* Don't try to position cursor on higher line to avoid numerous beeps (bash, clink, etc.)
* [conemu#297](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/297): Show option ‘Delay between consoles initialization’ on the ‘Startup’ page.

* fix cppcheck warning: Logical conjunction always evaluates to false: asLabel && !asLabel
* fix cppcheck warning: Logical conjunction always evaluates to false: pszNumEnd && !pszNumEnd
* fix cppcheck warning: Invalid memcmp() argument #3. A non-boolean value is required
* DefTerm. Improve error message, version, process name.
* [conemu#322](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/322): Fix crash in hooked applications while updating DefTerm module.
* Print handles information in `ConEmuC /checkunicode`.
* Add new color schemes: `<ConEmu>`, `<Cobalt2>`.
* Use `<ConEmu>` color scheme by default.
* [conemu#345](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/345): ‘Run as Administrator’ was crashed in some cases.
* Only active split was updated after choosing palette from DDCB.
* Misprint: Looses -> Loses.
* ANSI: Brightness (back/fore) was not reset in some cases.
  For example: `"\e[96mA\e[36mB"` - "B" and "A" had same color.
* Fix handle leak (GetProcessBits, handle is not freed)
* [conemu#368](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/368): Fix thread handles leaks.
* Append optional switches to single-command tasks.
  For example, there is default task `{cmd}` which has single command:
  `cmd /k "%ConEmuBaseDir%\CmdInit.cmd"`.
  Now you may to run `{cmd} /git` from NewConsole dialog or via `-cmd`
  switch of ConEmu.exe. So, the result will be:
  `cmd /k "%ConEmuBaseDir%\CmdInit.cmd" /git`.
* ConEmu here: Suggest to start `{cmd}` task instead of bare `cmd` by default.
  * So the default command for ‘ConEmu Here’ will be `{cmd} -cur_console:n`.
    * **Note**. Prepend `/reuse /cmd ` before task name, if you want to reuse
      running ConEmu window: `/reuse /cmd {cmd} -cur_console:n`.
  * Default command for ‘ConEmu Inside will be `{powershell} -cur_console:n`.
