* [conemu#861](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/861): Support RAlt the same way as Alt+Numbers (keypad).
* Predefined palettes were not initialized in some cases.
* [conemu#1620](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1620): Fade colors were wrong if ConEmu was started with `-Palette` switch.
* [conemu#1623](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1623): Let `Ctrl+0` and GuiMacro `Tab(7,-1)` activate *last* tab.
* [conemu#1637](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1637): Show message about absent DosBox required files.
* Fix unexpected pane-1 activation on mouse hover when pane-2 ChildGui popup dialog is over pane-1.
* [conemu#1662](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1662): Escape Char not working for passwords with trailing quote.
* [conemu#1573](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1573): Interface language setting was not saved.
* Add a new option to auto-trim single lines.
  When pasting a single line ending in newline, the user is presented with a
  warning about pasting multi-line strings. This enables a new option to
  automatically strip trailing newlines whenever we detect that a single line
  string has been pasted. This prevents the warning and allows the user to more
  conveniently edit single lines pasted into the console.
* Add German translation to ConEmu.l10n.
* Add icon ID number for VS2019 in CreateVCTask.
* GitShowBranch: Case insensitive check for no branch.
