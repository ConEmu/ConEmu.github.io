* [conemu#412](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/412): Failed to restore window position on secondary monitor (d3da351 regression).
* Far Manager plugins ‘ConEmu Background’ and ‘ConEmu Underlines’ were not working on Windows 7.
* First user palette was multiplied on sequental TabMenu calls ‘View (palettes)’.
* On ‘Debug active process...’ always show ‘New console’ dialog.
  So user may run debugger in a split or even change debugger comand line.
* Allow to set hotkeys for debugging menu items.
  * Debug active process (default is `Win+Shift+D`);
  * Active process memory dump;
  * Active process tree memory dump.
* For debugger NewConsole dialog suggest '30%' for split and don't autoselect command.
* Debugger. Switch `/AUTOMINI` will create sequential mini-dumps.
  * So, it may be useful for creating ‘mini snapshots’ of running
  application with specified time intervals.
  After `/AUTOMINI` switch user may specify interval.
  Milliseconds: `/AUTOMINI 500` or `/AUTOMINI 500ms`;
  seconds: `/AUTOMINI 5s`; and minutes: `/AUTOMINI 1m`.
  * Create sequental dumps of 64bit PID=1234 with 500ms interval:
  `ConEmuC64.exe /DEBUGPID=1234 /AUTOMINI 500`
  * Note. Press `Win+Shift+D` (default hotkey) to open NewConsole
  dialog with prefilled command to start debugger on the active
  process in the active console.
* GuiMacro: `Debug(<Action>)` allows to create debugger console or memory dumps.
