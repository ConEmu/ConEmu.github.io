* [conemu#509](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/509): Fix crash when checking ‘Explicit executable’.
* Use bare {Far} task name for first `Far.exe` found in our folder.
  To simplify portable and testing installations, if Far Manager
  is copied into our program folder, don't change its task name
  (don't add version/bitness suffixes).
* [conemu#507](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/507): Get rid of MsgBox on attach errors, print info to Console instead.
* [conemu#514](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/514): Fix broken pseudographics representation if ‘Alternative font’ was off.
* Prefer `bash.exe` over `sh.exe` when creating default tasks.
* gd#516: Support ‘Application Cursor Keys (DECCKM)’.
* Update `terminals` module to v0.7.4
* Let characters 0x1F300..0x1F5FF be double-width.
* [conemu#517](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/517): Radio-buttons Maximized and Fullscreen were not working (Apply is required though).
