* [conemu#880](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/880): Show the name of selected shell task for `Win+X` hotkey.
* [conemu#1517](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1517): After postponing update the ‘Confirm closing’ dialog stucks.
* Compact paths (%ConEmuDir%, %ConEmuCfgDir%, etc) by removing `\..\` elements.
  E.g. `C:\ConEmu\src\..\Debug\ConEmu.xml` will be processed now as `C:\ConEmu\Debug\ConEmu.xml`.
* [conemu#1046](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1046): Don't take into account path to xml settings storage in AppID generation if it's a default xml.
  If configuration file was set by argument `-LoadCfgFile "%ConEmuDir%\ConEmu.xml"`
  and it is *already* the default settings location (the same without `-LoadCfgFile` switch),
  than xml path is not used in AppID generation.
  Note: AppID is utilized during search for appropriate ConEmu instance
  when `-single` or `-reuse` switch were specified.
* By default add commented `LANG` variable and some aliases to ‘Environment’ settings page.
* Hidden cursor may be displayed as inactive (option for debug purposes).
* Add hotkey for ‘Check for updates’.
