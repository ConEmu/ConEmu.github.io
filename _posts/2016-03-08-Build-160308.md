* Option ‘Retard inactive panes’ was ignored in some cases.
* Trailing dot was not trimmed after md-style hyperlink.
* [conemu#420](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/420): Do not enable by default option ‘Process start’.
* Debugging purposes: `ConEmuC.exe -struct %ConEmuPID%`.
* In prompt, Shift+Home/End selects command text first, second press expands selection to line start/end.
* If selection was started from keyboard, than Del/Shift-Del/Backspace removes selected text.
  ConEmu tries to ‘map’ single Del/BS to series of keypresses to remove whole selected block.
  Only one-line selections are processed.
  Shift-Del do copying to clipboard before erasion.
* Allow persistent mouse selection. Selection will reset on Paste or Typing.
* When selection crosses anchor, behave same way if selection was started in that direction.
* ANSI: Implement `ESC ] 9 ; 12 ST` to store end of prompt message.
* l10n: Update chinese translation.
