* Terminal modes were not displayed on Settings/Info page.
* [conemu#716](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/716): Cygwin/msys connector output was broken after starting nano.
* [conemu#722](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/722): Treat Unicode range U+2700..U+27BF as double width glyphs.
* [conemu#718](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/718): Minimal cursor size option was ignored for invalid console cursor size (zero size).
* [conemu#719](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/719): Write cursor information and console window rect to log file.
* Print more console information in `ConEmuC -checkunicode`.
* [conemu#723](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/723): Let ‘Minimize/Restore’ hotkey act in spite of ‘Always on top’ mode.
* Don't process (append) environment variable twice (ref [conemu#724](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/724)).
  Example: `PATH=%ConEmuBaseDir%\Scripts;%PATH%;C:\Tools\Arc`
  So, do not add `%ConEmuBaseDir%\Scripts;` and `;C:\Tools\Arc`
  if they already exist in PATH. Only explicit comparison is done,
  so, if `C:\Tools\Arc` is in the middle of current `%PATH%`,
  it would be processed (appended).
* Fix: Console progress `0%` was detected during tab startup (regression 69439a3).
* Default task {Far}: don't double plugin folders to avoid doubled lines in F11 (Far 1.x and Far 2.x `/p` switch problem).
* [conemu#700](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/700): Show tab icon for Far editors and viewers if ‘Far windows’ option is off.
