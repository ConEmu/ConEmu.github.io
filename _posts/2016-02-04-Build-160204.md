* Support `Alt`-`+`-`HexNumber` input internally, including surrogate pair generation.
  ConEmu is able to convert entered codepoints to surrogate pairs,
  so you may enter uncommon symbols outside from BMP. Examples below.
  * Double-struck ‘𝔸’: press `Alt`-`+`-`1D538`.
  * Sushi emoticon ‘🍣’: press `Alt`-`+`-`1F363`
  * [More information](https://conemu.github.io/en/AltNumpad.html)
* Screen was not updated if shell (cmd for example) was activated back
  from closed Far Manager, if close has been done by cross-click
  and ‘Safe Far Close’ macro.
* [conemu#524](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/524): Deal with entangled window list returned by Far API.
