* Task for ‘Bash on Ubuntu on Windows’ was not created properly in 32-bit ConEmu on 64-bit Win10.
  Also, it's named now just a {Bash::bash}.
* New StatusBar columns: ‘Terminal modes’ and ‘RealConsole modes’ (generally for troubleshooting).
  * ‘Terminal modes’ shows keyboard modes and some flags:
    Windows, Xterm, App cursor keys, Bracketed paste, Cygwin, msys1, msys2 or clinK.
    E.g. `XC` means `X`term keyboard mode and `C`ygwin active console application.
  * ‘RealConsole modes’ shows current values of GetConsoleMode for ConIn and ConOut.
* GuiMacro: `TermMode(<Mode>[,<Action>])`.
  Ref gh-629: To ‘fix’ arrow keys in vim in bash on Ubuntu on Windows
  one may set hotkey for macro `TermMode(2)` and switch keyboard mode
  manually when vim (linux process) is started and exited.
