* AnsiLog was not written properly in some cases.
* Reuse HandleKeeper to determine console handle properties properly
  * ANSI coloring is supported while redirecting text to `CON` from batches.
    Example for cmd prompt: `call cecho "Redirected output" > CON`.
  * Output of msvcrt linked applications, like `PING` or `TRACERT`,
    may be logged (Settings\Features\Log console output).
* [conemu#461](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/461): Fix AeroPeek VCon offset when frame is non-resizable.
* [conemu#210](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/210): Minimizing other windows causes ConEmu to be restored (Quake).
* First try to draw non-spacings/combinings/surrogates/double-width in ‘proper’ size.
  For example, combining accents/umlauts must be shown over preceding letter,
  CJK double-width characters must use two cells to avoid overlapping.
  But that raise some other problems if console application don't care about this.
  For example: Far Manager frames may look corrupted after CJK file names.
* Don't try to pop up console menu by Shift+RClick while LBtn selection is present.
* Make IDM_CLOSE (Tab/Console menu item) behavior more conistent.
  * If menu's opened by RClick on console or by hotkey:
    do ‘Close console’.
  * If menu's opened by TabBar's RClick and it's a group with several tabs:
    do ‘Close tab group’.
  * Otherwise: do ‘Close tab’.
* ConEmu Inside: Terminate our process (ConEmu.exe) if parent window was killed.
* Don't try to hide to TSA in Inside mode.
* [conemu#467](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/467): Startup crash if startup task was renamed.
* Arbitrary shells (not a Task) were not accepted in FastConfiguration dialog.
* Let's save integers as user-friendly 10-based numbers (new xml configs).
* Allow AutoUpdates to ‘Stable’ builds.
* GuiMacro: GetInfo("Root") returns information of current console root process (JSON).
  * If there's no console at all - macro returns either empty string,
    or somthing like "FAILED:Specified ConEmu instance is not found".
  * On errors you may receive `{"Status":"Unknown"}`.
  * Normally, JSON object is expected. Example below, `//` for comments.

~~~
{
"Running": false,  // true or false
"Name": "cmd.exe", // name of root process executable
"PID": 1234,       // PID of root process
"ExitCode": 1,     // 259 if still running, or its exitcode
"UpTime": 12418    // milliseconds
}

* GuiMacro: Avoid `VConRequired` error macro was received before RCon created.
* GuiMacro: If `ConEmuC -GuiMacro` was started before ConEmu GUI finishes initialization,
  wait for ConEmu window appears or ConEmu.exe process terminates.
* Option ‘Skip click on activation’ was not working on ‘touch’.
* [conemu#310](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/310): Chars entered by Alt+Numpad were not working.
* Warning fixes (from Michael Lukashov).
