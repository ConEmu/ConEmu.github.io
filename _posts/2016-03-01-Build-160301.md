* [conemu#562](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/562): Environment was not applied to elevated consoles.
* Window icon was changed by mistake when starting task with defined icon.
  This must happen only for startup task.
* StatusBar was not updated after root process termination.
  Especially for consoles started with `-new_console:c0` or `-new_console:c1`.
* [conemu#561](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/561): Tab macro `%d` was not trimmed to ‘Max tab width’.
* For TaskBar with small icons show current console icon instead of ConEmu default (option ‘Admin shield’).
* GuiMacro: `GetInfo("Root")` XML-result changes.
