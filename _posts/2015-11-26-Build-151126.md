* First try to create [cygwin/msys terminal connector](https://github.com/Maximus5/cygwin-connector/releases/tag/v0.3).
* JumpList icon was not created properly for Task in some cases.
  If `/icon` switch was not specified for Task parameters,
  and first line of Task commands started with specials `*` or `>`,
  JumpList icon was not created properly.
* [conemu#431](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/431): Fix crash in EmergencyShow (Win10, closing ConEmu).
* Show in the StatusBar cygwin/msys connector's PID as AltServer.
* Pass UTF-8 encoded strings to debugger (ANSI debug logging).
* ANSI: Implement `ESC [ 3 J`: dispose all backscroll lines (from xterm).
* ANSI: Implement `ESC ] 9 ; 10 ST` - Request xterm keyboard emulation.
* Testing purposes: Options `-a` and `-s` in `ConEmuC -type`.
  `-a` writes text to console using MBCS functions.
  `-s` writes text to console byte-by-byte (streaming).
  Example: `ConEmuC -t -a -s UTF-8-broken.txt`.
* Improve UTF-8 support. In some cases, console output was broken.
* Internal. Reset m_Term on tab restart
* ANSI: Support xterm bracketed paste mode.
  Console application should write `\e[?2004h` to enable and `\e[?2004l`
  to disable bracketed paste mode.
  When mode is enabled, ConEmu sends pasted text to console input buffer
  framed into `\s[200~` ... `\e[201~`.
* ANSI: Long OSC sequences written splitted by writes were processed improperly.
* Don't treat cygwin/msys connector as ‘Incomplete operation’.
* Warnings fixes (from Michael Lukashov).
