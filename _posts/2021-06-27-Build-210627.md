* [conemu#2261](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/2261): Far executor fix.
* [conemu#2329](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/2329): Support GuiMacro run from PseudoConsoles.
  For proper work of ConEmu environment variables ConEmuPID and ConEmuServerPID
  should be set properly. Variables are set by ConEmuC (console server)
  but they also have to be inherited by processes running in the
  PseudoConsole (Windows 10 feature).
