    Only file name (path) was highlighted without following line number.
* Highlight & goto detector was failed if mouse was before first backslash of the path.
* [conemu#205](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/205): TabBar was not shown on startup in some monitor configurations (bacc66d regression).
