* gh-629: Support xterm keyboard emulation for ‘Bash on Ubuntu on Windows’.
  conhost does not do keypressed translation, if they were posted directly to console input.
  That's why switch `-cur_console:p1` must be used to turn on internal xterm emulation in ConEmu.
  So, the task {Bash-on-Ubuntu} would be:

~~~
%windir%\system32\bash.exe -cur_console:p1
~~~

* New default task {Bash::Bash on Ubuntu} for Windows 10 (if the feature is turned on in Windows).
* gh-637, gh-626: Access vialation on entering plugin ‘ConEmu Background’.
* Environment variables: `ConEmuArgs` and `ConEmuArgs2`.
  * `ConEmuArgs` now contains only ConEmu.exe's ‘switches’ (before `-cmd` or `-cmdlist`).
  * New variable `ConEmuArgs2` contains the command only: `-cmd ...` or `-cmdlist ...`.
* Reuse `ConEmuArgs` when starting new ConEmu instance from cmd autorun.
* gh-614, gh-616: Handle commas as decimal separators in the in-console progress detection.
  This fixes `curl -# -O` looping between 0 and 9%.
* Do not apply the icon from {Task} if option ‘Show overlay icon’ is on, to avoid two similar icons, one over another.
