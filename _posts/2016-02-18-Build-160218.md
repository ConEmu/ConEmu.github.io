* GuiMacro. New function `Write("Text")` writes "Text" to console output (dangerous).

  Use it at you own risk! Calling this function may cause unexpected behavior
  of running console application! That is because function changes console
  contents and cursor position directly, bypassing detouring standard
  ConIn/ConOut processing queue.

  In most cases **safe** functions `Paste`, `Print` and `Keys` are preferable!

  However, with `Write` you may implement some interesting features,
  like printing sort of ‘hints’ in shell prompt:

    Write "\e7\e[90mEcho \"Hello world!\"\e[m\e8"

* [conemu#550](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/550), [conemu#372](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/372), [conemu#234](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/234): Unassigned by default hotkey ‘Reset terminal’ (dangerous).

  I'm still sure that this operation is harmful and dangerous:
  <https://conemu.github.io/en/ClearScreen.html>.
  But since GuiMacro `Write` exists, anyone may create a macro
  for `Write("\ec")`, which the hotkey actualy executes.

  TabMenu item ‘Edit -> Reset terminal’ is available too.

  BTW, with `Write` macro anyone may push to console several colored lines,
  using ANSI sequences, to ‘mark’ some point in real-time logs (tail -f).

    Write "\n\n\e[91m========== '\e]9;8;\"time\"\e\\' ==========\e[m\n\n"

* Bring here: Just move window to the upper-left corner of active monitor.
* ANSI: Let `ESC ] 9 ; 8 ; "*env*" ST` supports `date` and `time`.
