* ComSpec setting page moved under DefTerm.
* Avoid attempt to hook DefTerm from multiple processes in Aggressive mode.
* Improve logging of DefTerm internals.
* [conemu#604](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/604): Some improvements on cmd automatic attach.
  The method may be registered on the ‘ComSpec’ settings page.
  However, it's not a recommended option, because ConEmu has very slight
  control over it, and even the logic ‘when we need to attach or not’
  is fuzzy.
* [conemu#604](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/604): Registration buttons were not processed properly on ConSpec settings page.
* Corrections in `-new_console` switch trimming procedure.
  * The space was not trimmed in `/C "C:\Temp\run.cmd -cur_console:o"`.
  * Unexpected assertion removed in `/C "C:\Temp\run_pause.cmd "-cur_console:o""`
* Don't run the command started by Shift-Enter from Far Manager via ConEmuC.exe.
  If one needs the command to be started in new ConEmu tab,
  than install the Macro: `ConEmu/Far3_lua/ConEmu.ShiftEnter.lua`.
* Don't bypass MouseMove events to Far Menus when selection modifiers are pressed.
* [conemu#621](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/621): Try to mimic standard Windows Alt+Numbers behavior.
