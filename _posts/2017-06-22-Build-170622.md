* gh-136: Swap nearest panes with `Apps+Alt+X`, swap in direction with `Apps+Alt+Arrow`.
* Let `Apps+Shift+G` group input for all consoles (instead of only visible panes like `Apps+G` does).
* Use by default `Ctrl+Numbers` to switch consoles (instead of `Win+Numbers`).
* Use by default `Win+Shift+Q` for ‘Switch next console’ by default. Leave hotkey `Win+Q` to Windows.
  The `Win+Shift+Q` may be useful to switch Tabs when ChildGui is active.
