* [conemu#712](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/712): Total consoles count was not displayed in the title properly (regression 7ed745b).
* [conemu#678](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/678): Selection vanished from screen after multiple page selection.
* System menu item ‘Debug’ -> ‘Dump screen’ saved empty png file.
* Fix Shift-Home selection in cmd.exe prompt after Tab-completion.
  First Shift-Home is expected to select the typed command without prompt.
  Sequential Shift-Home keypresses select and unselect prompt part.
* Let Shift-Home select multiline commands in cmd.exe prompt.
* [conemu#687](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/687): Settings page ‘Integration’ -> ‘ANSI execution’ to control allowed code and macro.

  This allows [ConEmu specific OSC](https://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html#ConEmu_specific_OSC)
  to be executed: `^]]9;6;"*macro*"^]\` and `^]]9;7;"*cmd*"^]\`.

  Since now, they allowed by default in `cmd.exe` only (were implemented for `GitShowBranch.cmd`).
  User may also disable or enable they for any process.

  Also, there is a list of allowed commands. Commands are case-sensitive, one line - one command.
  User may use `*` to allow bunch of commands by ‘mask’.
