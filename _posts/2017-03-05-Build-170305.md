* gh-1055: Fix ‘Delete word lefward to the cursor’ at the bottom of the screen.
* gh-787: Keyboard shortcut to scroll by prompts.
  Ctrl+Alt+PgUp/PgDn will jump between commands entered in the shell prompt.
  Take into account that prompt must pass to ConEmu the code
  `ESC]9;12ESC\` (ConEmu default) or `ESC[?7711h` (mintty implementation).
