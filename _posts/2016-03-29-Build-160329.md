* Redesign ‘Keys & Macro’ settings page. Let `Alt+F` put focus into the ‘Filter’ field.
* Hotkey `Ctrl+Alt+Break` was not processed properly.
* LogFile was not created when ‘Internal LogFiles’ checkbox was on.
* Simplify switching between Tasks on the ‘Tasks’ settings page (Up/Down keys if checkbox/button has focus).
* [conemu#404](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/404), [conemu#322](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/322): Fix crash in the integrated applications after ConEmu update (DefTerm).
  The effect will be noticed on the **next** update.
