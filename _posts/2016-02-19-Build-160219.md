* Task may be executed in the running console with `ConEmuC -c {TaskName}`.

  Actually, first command of the named task is executed,
  and rest of command line is appended as arguments.
  For example, you may start Far editor in the **current**
  console by executing in the prompt:

    ConEmuC -c {Far} /e text.txt

* Support tasks nesting.

  Simple nesting is allowed, so one may create their own task,
  which starts {cmd}, {powershell} and {VS 14.0 x86 tools prompt},
  even in splits or with extra arguments. For example:

    {cmd} & echo Extra args
    {powershell} -new_console:sV

* New predefined environment variables: `ConEmuTask` and `ConEmuPalette`.
* TaskBar JumpList icons fix.
* Far Macro: ConEmu.Editor.lua was broken (Far3 latest builds).
* Far Tabs were not updated in ConEmu after plugin call `Plugin.SyncCall(ConEmu,100)`.
