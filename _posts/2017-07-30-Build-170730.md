* Unchecked option ‘Use credentials for network resources only’ was ignored (f9805dccf regression).
  Entered credentials were used only for network resources regardless of the option value.
* gh-811, gh-1199: Fix race while starting applications requesting XTerm emulation (WSL, cygwin, msys).
* gh-1194: Button ‘Clone’ in Settings/Tasks.
* Use conemu-cyg-64.exe with wslbridge.exe to run WSL bash.
  This concerns to {Bash::bash} task created by default,
  if cygwin's wslbridge files exist in `%ConEmuBaseDir%/wsl`.
  Connector version 1.2 is required. wslbridge added to ConEmu distro.
* gh-648, gh-1117: Support xterm mouse emulation (mc, WSL, etc.) Connector is required!
* Try to find all installations of cygwin (32bit and 64bit) to create default tasks.
* Find MSYS2 installations to create default tasks {Bash::Msys2-32} and {Bash::Msys2-64}.
