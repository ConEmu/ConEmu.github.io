* [conemu#2212](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/2212): Far 1.75 executor - fix run cmd scripts with space in the path, redirections
  or asFile specified in CreateProcess.
* Create default tasks for all found WSL distributions.
* Support loading tab icons for 64-bit system32 apps in 32-bit ConEmu (e.g. wsl.exe).
* [conemu#2253](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/2253): Fix 'Run as current user' radio box l10n.
* DefTerm: Support manual attach of the VsDebugConsole.exe console.
  If VsDebugConsole.exe was started outside of ConEmu without DefTerm,
  the process does not have ConEmuHk injected and after manual attach
  it could behave incorrectly on debugging program termination.
* [conemu#2250](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/2250): Fix sequence `ESC[3J` to clear backscroll buffer.
* l10n: translations were updated
* DefTerm: Activate VsDebugConsole tab when new session (run/debug) is starting.
* Reset dynamic scroll range after `cls` command.
