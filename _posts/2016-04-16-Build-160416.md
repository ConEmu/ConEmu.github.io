* gh-629: Once more ‘Bash on Ubuntu on Windows’.
  It's recommended now to run bash with `-cur_console:p` switch.
  **Delete trailing `1`** if you have {bash} task already.

~~~
-cur_console:p[N] - pty modes, N - bitmask, default is 1+4
   1 - XTermKeys, 2 - BrPaste, 4 - AppCursorKeys
~~~

* Support underlined text attributes (fish autocompletion).
* ConEmu.exe switches `-run` and `-runlist` are introduced to take the place of `-cmd` and `-cmdlist`.
  * Actually, `-cmd` and `-cmdlist` are supported for compatibility reasons,
    but `-run...` switches are more convenient to avoid confusion with `cmd.exe`.
  * As before, both `/switch` and `-switch` notations are supported.
  * Also, ConEmu internals were changed to `-switch` notation.
* gh-641: Correct posting `0x7F` (which is `<BS>` on xterm) to console.
  It was posted with LEFT_CTRL_PRESSED in dwControlKeyState. We are posting `<BS>`, but not a `<Ctrl>-<BS>`.
