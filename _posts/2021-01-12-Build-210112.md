* [conemu#2243](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/2243): Fix arrow key issue in cygwin pseudo console. (#2245)
* Add `ConEmuC -verbose` switch to force called functions printing to stdout (debugging purposes).
* Don't show MessageBox on injects failures in ConEmuC.exe, print error to stdout instead. May be suppressed by `-silent` switch.
* Workaround for Win10 bug leading to invisible leading 4 characters in prompt after exit from `cmd.exe /k wsl.exe`.
