* [conemu#268](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/268): Support DefTerm for CodeBlocks. User have to add `codeblocks.exe|gdb.exe` to hooked executables.
* [conemu#255](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/255), old#1065: Add option ‘Restore to active monitor’ to the ‘Size & Pos’ settings page.
  It moves window to active monitor from inactive by Min/Restore hotkey even if window is visible.
