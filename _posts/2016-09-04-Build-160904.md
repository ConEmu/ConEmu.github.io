* GuiMacro: Detach(1) didn't disable confirmation.
* gh-841: Support COMMON_LVB_REVERSE_VIDEO console attribute.
* gitextensions/gitextensions#3263: Inside mode: Don't run console ‘As Admin’ if Shift is pressed.

  Remove ambiguous option to run started elevated console (Run As Admin).
  If ConEmu was started by some shortcut with `Shift` key,
  user faced the unexpected UAC confirmation.

  If user want to run elevated console, they may use special Task
  with `-cur_console:a` switch. Example: {cmd (Admin)}.

  If developer want to run ConEmu console in elevated mode,
  they may add `-cur_console:a` switch *after* `-run` switch.
  Example: `ConEmu.exe -run cmd.exe -cur_console:a /k <some command>`.
