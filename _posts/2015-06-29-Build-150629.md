* Attach (Win+G) was not succeeded if ConEmu has different bitness.
* Grab palette from Win+G attached consoles (Vista+) and create new
    if matching one was not found. These palettes ‘#Attached:XX’ are not
    saved automatically, but will be when user presses ‘Save settings’ button
    in the settings dialog.
* [conemu#193](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/193): Show hookers warning once per day.
* Show real names for ‘Win+Number’ and ‘Win+Arrows’ on the Controls page.
* Search for static text control in the Settings dialog was failed.
* Issue 1977: Don't change RealConsole height on tabs auto-show/hide,
    resize ConEmu window height instead.
* Add some urls to ConEmu.nuspec (chocolatey).
* When tabs are auto shown icon was not loaded for the first tab.
* Environment variables export was improved (some internal fixes).
