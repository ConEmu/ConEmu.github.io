* [conemu#661](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/661): If ConEmu started with `-detached` switch, option ‘Close with last tab’ couldn't be changed.
* Improve debug shell logging (source of `@file` without paths).
  Settings/Info/Debug has ‘Shell’ option which shows processes creation information.
  E.g. if you run project make, and make executes `lnk @arguments`, the `arguments`
  is usually temporary file, which contains actual agruments for linking.
  ConEmu tries to locate the file (passed to `lnk` without path) and shows its
  contents in Settings/Info/Debug.
