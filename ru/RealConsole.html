<p><a href="ConEmu.html">ConEmu</a> always run standard Windows console - ‘Real console’, but it is hidden most of time. </p>
<p>Many users erroneously name it as <tt>cmd.exe</tt>, but it is not true. Windows console window is a part of Windows kernel (<tt>csrss.exe</tt> up to Vista and <tt>conhost.exe</tt> in Windows 7 and higher). And you may run there console applications: <tt>cmd.exe</tt>, <tt>powershell.exe</tt> and many others are shells and tools. </p>
<p>If you need to take a look at ‘Real console’ just press (simultaneously) in the <a href="ConEmu.html">ConEmu</a> window ‘Ctrl+Win+Alt+Space’. Alternatively - <a href="SystemMenu.html">SystemMenu</a> -&gt; Debug -&gt; Real console. </p>
<p>Sometimes you may see flickering ‘Real console’ during <a href="ConEmu.html">ConEmu</a> tab startup. That is intended behavior for ‘Run as administrator’ and debugging using <a href="DefaultTerminal.html">Default terminal</a> feature. </p>
