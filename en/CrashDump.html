<h1>Reporting ConEmu crashes </h1>

<p>ConEmu is stable enough. </p>
<p><strong>Note!</strong> I often have reports related to several <a href="MicrosoftBugs.html">MicrosoftBugs</a>. If you see the crash, please read <a href="MicrosoftBugs.html">wiki</a> and make sure <a href="ConEmuHk.html">Inject ConEmuHk</a> feature is enabled! </p>
<p>Well, if any unknown crash was occured in <code>ConEmu</code> or <code>ConEmuC</code> processes, <a href="MemoryDump.html">MemoryDump</a> may greatly help to locate and fix the problem. </p>
<p>Crashes in <code>ConEmu[64].exe</code> and <code>ConEmuC[64].exe</code> are handled automatically and application suggests to user (message box) to create <a href="MemoryDump.html">MemoryDump</a> (full or mini). Due to limitation of googlecode attachments, please upload dumps to <a href="DropBox.html">DropBox</a> or any other hosting and post the link to issues or via email. </p>
<p>ConEmu does not handle crashes (exceptions actually) in the running console applications. That is because to minimize intrusion to running application. </p>
<p>If you need to create dump manually (of any ConEmu&#x27;s processes or console application) please read that <a href="MemoryDump.html">wiki</a>. </p>
