# DependencyWalker

[Dependency Walker](http://www.dependencywalker.com/) builds hierarchical tree
of the dynamic libraries used by process.

It may work either ‘offline’ without actual executable run,
or ‘online’ mode, monitoring all modules, debug messages,
threads initializations and many other low-level information.
