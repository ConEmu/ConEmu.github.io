# Control ConEmu window position and size

There are many possibilities to move and resize ConEmu window,
even if you have disabled window title and border!

* Drag [grip in StatusBar](StatusBar.html) (right-bottom window corner)
  to resize window.
* Drag [TabBar](TabBar.html) by free space
  (between rightmost tab and search field/toolbar)
  to move window.
* Press `Ctrl+Alt` and drag window by [console working area](VirtualConsole.html)
  to move window. Combo `Ctrl+Alt` is [configurable](SettingsHotkeys.html).
* At last, you may **hover** mouse cursor over ConEmu border, to reveal
  resizable frame.

Also, there are [configurable hotkeys](KeyboardShortcuts.html) to decrease/increase
window width/height.
Just open [Settings/Keys & Macro](SettingsHotkeys.html) and search for ‘window width’.

## Settings page

Of course, there is a [Size & Pos](SettingsSizePos.html) settings page where
you may change all parameters manually and save them.
