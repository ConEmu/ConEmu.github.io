# Update your installation

If you are using old build, there is big chance that your problem was fixed already.
Don't waste your time reporting problems of Old Builds.
Why not to update?

Note, if you are using third-party bundles (like cmder or chocolatey)
you most probably are using not latest build.
There is ConEmu **internal** updater.
Just call it from [SystemMenu](SystemMenu.html) \ `Help` \ `Check for updates`.
Or visit download page at [FossHub](http://www.fosshub.com/ConEmu.html).

Also, thanks to googlecode for stopping Download service,
if you are using **very old build** (pre 140115)
ConEmu automatic update will be processed in **two steps**.


## Version check

ConEmu version is visible in the status bar, Settings or About dialogs.
Just press `Win+Alt+A` to be sure ([SystemMenu](SystemMenu.html) \ `Help` \ `About`).
