# What is an Apps key?

This key (mentioned as `VK_APPS` in `WinUser.h`)
is located between `RightWin` and `RightControl` on the most of
[keyboard layouts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Klawiatura_maszynistki.jpg).

Sometimes it's called `Application/Menu`.
Thought, it is not correct in Windows because `VK_MENU`
(from `WinUser.h`) refers to the `Alt` key in fact.
