# Hold Shell Prompt at the Bottom

Do you want to get your cmd.exe prompt bottom aligned?
On ConEmu startup and after "cls"?


## Far Manager  {#Far_Manager}

Actually, I can't understand why anyone use cmd as shell but not a [FarManager](FarManager.html).
It's a fast, handy and powerfull combination of:

* command prompt (you may run any console or GUI application from its prompt,
  any %COMSPEC% commands, can be integrated with powershell);
* two pane file manager (copy/move files, create directories and hard links,
  browse remote hosts, and so on); you have no need in file manager?
  are you sure you are working on your PC?
* powerful and fast editor with syntax highlighting;
* dozens of miscellaneous plugins for anyone taste and purpose;

Try it! [Download](http://www.farmanager.com/download.php?l=en) and install into ConEmu's folder
(put far.exe near to ConEmu.exe) and run it.
If you don't need panels on startup (really?) - press **Ctrl+O**, **Ctrl+B**
and save configuration changes **Shift+F9**.
You will get command prompt with permanent history (Alt+F8).


## Plain cmd.exe  {#Plain_cmd.exe}

OK. If you still want use plain "cmd.exe" - here is one trick
using [AnsiEscapeCodes](AnsiEscapeCodes.html).

### Set up your task   {#Set_up_your_task}

![cmd.exe prompt at the bottom - 1](/img/PromptAtBottom1.png "Prompt at the bottom of ConEmu window")


### Choose it as startup task   {#Choose_it_as_startup_task}

![cmd.exe prompt at the bottom - 2](/img/PromptAtBottom2.png "Prompt at the bottom of ConEmu window")


### Prompt will appears at the bottom   {#Prompt_will_appears_at_the_bottom}
