<p>One of the most asked questions related to bash is ‘How to run some command on startup and leave bash run interactively?’ </p>
<p>The simplest thing with cmd.exe - /k switch, but the bash has no equivalent. </p>
<p>Of course, the question is not related to <a href="ConEmu.html">ConEmu</a>, but let it be here. The example lines were copied from <a href="http://superuser.com/a/344486/139371" rel="nofollow">SU question</a>. </p>
<p>You need to modify your <code>~/.bashrc</code> profile script adding at the end: </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">[[ $startup_cmd ]] &amp;&amp; {
  declare +x startup_cmd
  eval &quot;$startup_cmd&quot;
}</pre>

<p>And configure your <a href="ConEmu.html">ConEmu</a>&#x27;s task like following: </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">  set &quot;startup_cmd=echo &#x27;This is sample command&#x27; &amp;&amp; echo &#x27;And this is another command&#x27;&quot; &amp;&amp; bash -l -i</pre>
