# ConEmu's StatusBar

Status bar may be really useful.

* What process is executing in the console now?
* What console (index) is active?
* What is the size of console buffer?
* Where is cursor located?
* Caps/Num/Scroll, transparency, zoom, time and much more columns are available.

Many of these columns are ‘clickable’ (try both LClick and RClick).

Of course you may configure columns set or hide StatusBar
in the [Settings](SettingsStatusBar.html).

{% if site.url != 'local' %}{% include in_article.html %}{% endif %}
