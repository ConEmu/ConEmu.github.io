# Localization (l10n)

**Work in progress**

If you want to translate ConEmu interface to your language,
your localization efforts would be appreciated.

## Where language resources are stored  {#resources}

All language resources are located in the file
[/Release/ConEmu/ConEmu.l10n](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/daily/Release/ConEmu/ConEmu.l10n).
Don't forget to checkout latest **daily** branch if you work with local sources.


## Resource file format  {#format}

The format of the JSON file is simple and was designed to easify patches.
The file consists of several sections: `languages` for list of languages;
`cmdhints`, `mnuhints` and `controls` for resources themselves.

The resource may be either simple "string", or an ["array ", "of ", "strings"]
which are concatenated without changes at run time.

            , "ConEmu-YYYY-MM-DD-pNNNN.log\r\n" ],
      "id": 2679 }
  }
}
~~~


## How to add new language  {#new-lang}

1. Add to the `languages` new record. Example below adds Russian with id `ru`.
2. Translate all entries by adding `ru` record to each resource.

## Resources deprecation  {#deprecation}

If the `en` resource is changed, other languages translations become deprecated.
To depict that, language id-s for this resource would be prefixed with `_`
(`ru` -> `_ru`).
So, translation maintainers may easily find changed resources.

~~~
﻿{
    "bResetSettings": {
      "en": "Reset all settings to defaults",
      "_ru": "Сбросить настройки к умолчаниям",
      "id": 1595 }
}
~~~


## How to test  {#test}

The work is still in progress...
At the moment only hints and Settings dialog controls are processed by l10n engine.

To check the translation:

* Download and install [actual build]({{ site.github }}).
* Place the file [ConEmu.l10n](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/daily/Release/ConEmu/ConEmu.l10n)
  into `%ConEmuBaseDir%` and run `ConEmu.exe` with your language code.

~~~
ConEmu.exe -lng "ru"
~~~

Alternatively, you may specify the location of the file with `-lngfile` argument.

~~~
ConEmu.exe -lng "ru" -lngfile "full-path-to-l10n"
~~~

Also, the button `Reload...` in the Settings dialog would reload language data too,
and resources will be applied to dialog controls when you open the dialog next time.
