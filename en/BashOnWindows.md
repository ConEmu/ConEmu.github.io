# Bash on Windows

At first, official place for bugs of ‘Windows Subsystem for Linux’ is:
<https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/>.

**WSL** or ‘Windows Subsystem for Linux’ or ‘Bash on Ubuntu on Windows’
was brought to you by efforts of Microsoft and Canonical.
This subsystem allows users to run **native** linux binaries in Windows 10
without using of virtual machines or recompilations.

**Required** 64-bit version of Windows 10 Anniversary Update build 14316 or later!

Good places to start are:

* <https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/install_guide>
* <https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/about>

### TLDR: Installation  {#TLDR}

* ‘Settings’ -> ‘Update and Security’ -> ‘For developers’: Enable ‘Developer mode’
*  Reboot
* ‘Administrator's command prompt’ execute the following:

~~~
powershell -command Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
~~~

* After another reboot, run in the ‘command prompt’ to install required files:

~~~
%windir%\system32\bash.exe
~~~


## Some techinfo

Despite the fact WSL binaries runs in Windows console window,
they are not native Windows console applications (obviously)
and they are not using native
[Windows Console API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681913.aspx).

When you run `%windir%\system32\bash.exe` this native Windows process
starts ‘linux kernel’ outside of Windows console,
and linux applications commuticate with [conhost](ConsoleApplication.html#conhost)
without use of Windows Console API.

That means ConEmu can't ‘[hook](ConEmuHk.html)’ linux processes!
Unfortunately `bash.exe` which may be hooked is only a sort of
a loader for WSL, `bash.exe` does not do console output and
all [ANSI sequences](AnsiEscapeCodes.html) are processed **before**
ConEmu can see them. WSL process all ANSI and writes stripped
output directly to [conhost](ConsoleApplication.html#conhost).

Another problem is that due to mistake in WSL design,
keypresses written to [conhost](ConsoleApplication.html#conhost)
input buffer using **standard** Windows API function
[WriteConsoleInput](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms687403.aspx)
are not converted into xterm keyboard sequences.
But when user presses same key directly in [RealConsole](RealConsole.html)
they are converted properly.

Both problem have workarounds, read further.


## Get 24-bit colors working in ConEmu  {#true-color}

Ryan Prichard has created [wslbridge](https://github.com/rprichard/wslbridge)
which allows anyone to run WSL in any POSIX enabled terminal like mintty
or [ConEmu cygwin/msys connector](CygwinMsysConnector.html).

If you don't like to download megabytes of cygwin's installation,
you may try precompiled distribution of
[wsltty](https://github.com/mintty/wsltty/releases).
It's just a 32-bit bundle of mintty, cygwin1.dll and wslbridge.

Does not matter what bitness of cygwin binaries you are trying,
wslbridge is just a ‘bridge’ between Windows terminal and your
64-bit linux applications which are running in WSL.

So, example of minimal working environment is below.
Just place these files in some folder on your NTFS drive,
I used the folder `C:\MSYS\WSL`.

| File | Source |
|:---|:---|
| conemu-cyg-32.exe | [latest connector release](https://github.com/Maximus5/cygwin-connector/releases) |
| wslbridge.exe <br/> wslbridge-backend | [wslbridge-*-cygwin32.tar.gz](https://github.com/rprichard/wslbridge/releases) |
| cygwin1.dll | <https://cygwin.com/> or [wsltty](https://github.com/mintty/wsltty/releases) |

Now you may run the command below. Don't forget to change `C:\MSYS\WSL` if you use different folder!
Also read about [-new_console switch](NewConsole.html).

~~~
conemu-cyg-32.exe ./wslbridge.exe -t "-new_console:C:%LOCALAPPDATA%\lxss\bash.ico" "-new_console:D:C:\MSYS\WSL" -new_console:np
~~~


### TLDR: Just run wslbridge  {#TLDR2}

Well, you may run `wsl-con.cmd` which would set up wslbridge for you.

**Warning**, if you have installed ConEmu in ‘Program Files’,
or any other protected location, please run `wsl-con.cmd`
as Administrator (from elevated ConEmu tab).

Download [wsl-con.cmd here](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/raw/daily/Release/ConEmu/wsl/wsl-con.cmd).


### How to get 24-bit colors working  {#true-color-example}

You need just few more files:

1) `256colors2.pl` download it from [./256colors2.pl]

2) `wsl-con.bat` to start new tab in ConEmu

~~~
@echo off
if "%~1" == "-run" goto run
ConEmuC -c "%~0" -run "-new_console:C:%LOCALAPPDATA%\lxss\bash.ico" "-new_console:D:%~dp0" -new_console:np
goto :EOF
:run
call SetEscChar
echo %ESC%[9999H
conemu-cyg-32.exe ./wslbridge.exe -t ./boot.sh
~~~

3) and `boot.sh` to print gradient map, system information and run bash prompt

~~~
#/bin/sh
uname -a
./256colors2.pl
cd ~
bash -l -i
~~~



## Get arrows working in ConEmu

This solution is **only for [Bash on Windows (WSL)](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows)**!
It does not rely to [Cygwin, MSYS](CygwinMsys.html) or [Git-for-Windows](GitForWindows.html)!

Due to the bug [BashOnWindows#111](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/111)
arrows were not working if you start `bash.exe` in old ConEmu builds.
More details in tickets
[BashOnWindows#111](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/111)
and
[ConEmu#629](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/629).

### Solution

1. Don't use [Old ConEmu Builds](OldBuild.html)!
   There is no sense to complain on things changed months ago!
   [Update](UpdateModes.html) your installation!
2. ConEmu creates new task for ‘Bash on Windows’ automatically,
   you may check this by running `ConEmu64.exe -basic -run {bash}`.
   Also, you may call [Add default tasks...](SettingsTasks.html#id2632)
   from [Tasks page](SettingsTasks.html) on your existing config.
3. So, just run `{bash}` [task](Tasks.html), arrow keys are expected
   to be working!

Alternatively, you may enable [StatusBar](StatusBar.html) column ‘Terminal modes’.
LeftClick the column and select ‘XTerm’ and ‘AppKeys’ when tab with Bash on Windows
is active.

Another alternative is [wslbridge](#true-color) described above.

{% comment %}
If you run ConEmu first time, or use [-basic](ConEmuArgs.html) switch,
or even call [Add default tasks...](SettingsTasks.html#id2632)
you'll get proper task for ‘Bash on Windows’

~~~
%windir%\system32\bash.exe -cur_console:p
~~~

This is the only way to tell ConEmu, that this executable is **so special**,
that **native** Windows console application, which obviously `bash.exe` is,
requires **Linux Escape sequences** instead of Windows native keyboard events.
