# ConEmu changes log

New ConEmu builds arrives often, at least weekly.
It's recommended to enable [Automatic Update](SettingsUpdate.html)
to get [Preview or Alpha](VersionComparison.html#release-stages)
builds as soon as they are released.




## Any contributions are appreciated

ConEmu-Maximus5 was brought to life and is supported by almost single developer efforts.

<!-- Content starts -->



## Build 150707  {#Build_150707}

* This build changes the download procedure used within automatic updates.
    ConEmu.exe (GUI) do not call WinInet functions anymore, instead it calls
    the downloader tool (ConEmuC.exe is an only option at the moment).
    This will eliminate accidental crashes of GUI after resume from sleep.
* The downloader itself has new options.
  * If user omit dst file name - try to get it from Url.
  * If "-" was specified as dst file name or output is redirected - just write contents to stdout.
  * New switch `-agent <name>` was implemented.



## Build 150705  {#Build_150705}

* Script `ConEmu/GitShowBranch.cmd` was improved.
* Highlight & goto was broken at least for powershell scripts (c8c386a regression).
    Only file name (path) was highlighted without following line number.
* Highlight & goto detector was failed if mouse was before first backslash of the path.
* [conemu#205](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/205): TabBar was not shown on startup in some monitor configurations (bacc66d regression).



## Build 150701  {#Build_150701}

* Add optional '/Silent' switch to suppress environment exporting messages.

		  ConEmuC [/SILENT] /EXPORT[=CON|GUI|ALL] [Var1 [Var2 [...]]]

* [conemu#193](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/193): Fix wrong condition: ‘Warn if MacType hookers are loaded’.
* Omit ConEmuC export variables message in GitShowBranch.cmd.
* [conemu#174](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/174): Let paste to all ‘grouped input’ consoles at once.

* Vert/Horz text cursor was displayed in wrong position especially on DBCS systems.
* Ctrl+BackSpace feature was not working on DBCS systems.
* Redirect chocolatey downloads to github.
* [conemu#204](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/204): ConEmu hung on startup in some cases while initializing default tasks.



## Build 150629  {#Build_150629}

* Attach (Win+G) was not succeeded if ConEmu has different bitness.
* Grab palette from Win+G attached consoles (Vista+) and create new
    if matching one was not found. These palettes ‘#Attached:XX’ are not
    saved automatically, but will be when user presses ‘Save settings’ button
    in the settings dialog.
* [conemu#193](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/193): Show hookers warning once per day.
* Show real names for ‘Win+Number’ and ‘Win+Arrows’ on the Controls page.
* Search for static text control in the Settings dialog was failed.
* Issue 1977: Don't change RealConsole height on tabs auto-show/hide,
    resize ConEmu window height instead.
* Add some urls to ConEmu.nuspec (chocolatey).
* When tabs are auto shown icon was not loaded for the first tab.
* Environment variables export was improved (some internal fixes).


## Build 150621  {#Build_150621}

* Use recommended launcher for Git-For-Windows bash (default tasks).
* Try to create default task for GitSDK bash.
* Let Settings\Environment page use one line for one command.
    This will make concrete set commands with quotation marks.
    Following two commands are equal.

        set "PATH=C:\Program Files\ConEmu;%PATH%"
        set PATH=C:\Program Files\ConEmu;%PATH%

    But you still have to use quotations to keep trailing spaces

        set "VarName=This is my value   "

* Support empty lines and comments on the Settings\Environment page.
  You may comment lines with `#`, `//`, `--` or `REM `.
* gh187: Highlight and goto did not work when filename not finished by :[space] or :[number].
* Improve default task names unification and sorting.
* The arrow char was inserted into Far Manager prompt after selecting text with Alt+Mouse.
* Fix xml search path for Git-For-Windows package.
  Correct one is `/opt/share/conemu/ConEmu.xml` while `ConEmu.exe` is placed
  in `/opt/bin` folder.
* Error code was not shown properly if DefTerm inject fails.



## Build 150610  {#Build_150610}

* Simplify `set` usage in Settings\Environment.
* [conemu#179](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/179): Fix broken environment inheritance (ca9e31a regression).
* Ensure that `set` commands in the task/command line will override ConEmu's default environment (settings page).
* GuiMacro: Make Task and Shell functions synchronous to be able to use Context function after it.
* GuiMacro: Return more information about wrong macro.
* GuiMacro: Easify calling functions with int arguments. "Sleep 500;" was not working.
* GuiMacro: Sleep function have not returned "OK" on success.
* Allow using `-new_console` and `-cur_console` switches to set DosKey aliases.
* Support aliases set up on the ConEmu Settings/Environment page. <br/>
    **Note!** These console aliases are processed by `cmd.exe` and `far.exe` only.
    If you need to set up aliases for other shells (PowerShell, bash, etc.)
    please refer to their manuals.  
    Defining aliases are similar to `doskey.exe`.
    Actually, you may define:

        alias alias=doskey $*

    After that you can use `alias` in the `cmd.exe` prompt started in ConEmu:

        alias sudo=ConEmuC -c $* -new_console:an

    That is just an example. It's more handy to add `sudo` definition into
    ConEmu Settings/Environment page.
    And when `sudo` is defined you may run from `cmd.exe` prompt, for example:

        sudo diskpart

* [conemu#176](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/176): Avoid creating two tabs while starting:

        git-bash.exe --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i

    However, preferred way to start Git-For-Windows in ConEmu tab is:

        git-cmd.exe --command=usr/bin/bash.exe -l -i

* Update ConEmuPortable.ini with Environment information.



## Build 150608  {#Build_150608}

* Quake mode enabled by `-quake` command line switch was not shown in Fast Configuration dialog.
* Suggest the task user specified by `ConEmu.exe -cmd {cmd}` in Fast Configuration dialog.
* Don't set default task in Fast Configuration dialog, use exact `-cmd ...` command specified by user.
* [conemu#151](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/151): Do (quake) animation after starting RealConsole creation.

* Ensure all default bash tasks names will be unique.
* Always reset FARHOME env.var when creating default Far tasks.
* Move checkboxes ‘Add ConEmu??? to PATH’ to separate page ‘Environment’.
* [conemu#171](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/171), Issue 1655: Add option to skip ‘... brought ConEmu OnTop. Revert?’ confirmation.
* [conemu#173](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/173): Attach of detached console ignored new ConEmu instance.
* [conemu#173](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/173): Implement Unfasten of console tabs (ChildGui not yet). Tab menu item, hotkey and GuiMacro.
* Implement ‘Settings\Environment’ page.
		User may define here multiple "set varname=varvalue" commands
		or set default console code page with "chcp utf-8", "chcp 866" and so on.
		Environment %variables% in 'varvalue' are allowed and would be expanded before do set.
		One line - one command (set or chcp).
* Create folder "ConEmu\Scripts" by installer.
		May be useful for storing user scripts (bat-files and so on).
		It would/may be added to PATH in the Settings\Environment page.
* Git-For-Windows: Search for xml in /share/conemu while ConEmu.exe is intended to be in /opt/bin.
* Log and warn (debug assertion) long alternative buffer loading.
* Many MINGW-build related fixes from @Alexpux.

## Build 150427  {#Build_150427}

* [conemu#112](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/112): Python with Tk: rightclick menu window not showing.
* Set `FARHOME` env.var in default created Far tasks.
    That is because otherwise FARHOME may hold wrong value
    and plugins may be loaded from wrong place.
    So, the example task `{Far Manager::Far 3.0 x64}` will be:

        set "FARHOME=C:\Program Files\Far Manager" & "%FARHOME%\far.exe" /w /p"%ConEmuDir%\Plugins\ConEmu;%FARHOME%\Plugins"

* Show link to ConEmuArgs.html on bad switch using.

* Don't add spare default Far tasks, UnExpand paths if possible.



## Build 150405  {#Build_150405}

* Choose preferred startup Task for new configs (Far -> TCC -> NYAOS -> cmd).
* Fix wrong position of duplicate hotkey warning balloon.
* Detect console buffer corruption and log it.Sometimes during kmk build script execution something very bad happens

That's because these folders may be used if user starts ConEmu (or just cmd as [DefTerm](DefTerm.html)) from bare Win+R. So, the switch "`/here`" was implemented, it's not shown in the Settings dialog. User needs to re-register ‘ConEmu here’ existing commands.

## Build 150216  {#Build_150216}

* [GuiMacro](GuiMacro.html). [Issue 1411&nbsp;](http://github.com/Maximus5/conemu-old-issues/issues/1411), gh#58. `WindowPosSize("<X>","<Y>","<W>","<H>")`. It changes window pos and size, same as ‘Apply’ button in the ‘Size & Pos’ page of the Settings dialog.
* [GuiMacro](GuiMacro.html). Simplify passing string arguments. For example, the following commands will be equal now:

        ConEmuC -GuiMacro WindowPosSize "0" "0" "800px" "600px"
        ConEmuC -GuiMacro WindowPosSize 0 0 800px 600px



## Build 150215  {#Build_150215}

* Add menu item ‘Online &Help’ to the [SystemMenu](SystemMenu.html).

* [Issue 1881&nbsp;](http://github.com/Maximus5/conemu-old-issues/issues/1881): Newly catched admin consoles were unexpectedly scrolled to the bottom ([DefTerm](DefTerm.html)).
* Catched [RealConsole](RealConsole.html) ([DefTerm](DefTerm.html)) was hidden even if ‘Show real console’ was ticked.
* Use bitmap resource for ‘Search’ icon.



## Build 150209  {#Build_150209}

* [Issue 1897](http://github.com/Maximus5/conemu-old-issues/issues/1897): Tear off started "ConEmu.exe" from "taskeng.exe" (switch /demote). Let process created from task sheduler runs indefinitely.
* Auto save window size & pos is turned on by default.
* Add test batch "utf-8-test.cmd" (check console unicode capabilities).

* [Issue 1870&nbsp;](http://github.com/Maximus5/conemu-old-issues/issues/1870): Rename dialog was shown out of screen if tabs were on bottom.



## Build 150206  {#Build_150206}

* CP hack: Use ConEmuCpCvt to force output CP conversion. If some command uses wrong CP while converting ANSI to Unicode (the example may be perl.exe from "git add -p") set variable to correct its output. Use asterisk for all apps. This hack affects ONLY WriteConsoleW function calls.

        Format:
          <exename>:<badcp>:<goodcp>[;<exename>:<badcp>:<goodcp>[...]]
        Example:
          set ConEmuCpCvt=perl.exe:1252:1251;*:850:866;

* CP hack: Use ConEmuDefaultCp to change output CP if you don't want to use chcp. If you can't use "`chcp <codepage>`" to change whole console CP output, you may change it using environment variable ConEmuDefaultCp. It will affect only WriteFile and WriteConsoleA functions. So, if you need to run several apps in one console simultaneously...

        set ConEmuDefaultCp=1251
        ConEmuC -fork -c App1.exe
        set ConEmuDefaultCp=866
        ConEmuC -fork -c App2.exe
        set ConEmuDefaultCp=

* Add information about "-Async", "-Fork", "-Download" switches.
* Switch "-noquake" implies "-nosingle".
* TaskBar jump list was created without directly specified xml configuration file.
* Button ‘Save’ instead of ‘Start’ was shown if bad startup Task was detected.
* The menu item ‘Clear history...’ was not working (the one in the <code class="plus">[+]</code> drop-down menu).
* Sometimes ‘Console script are not supported here’ error appeared after running a task from [NewConsole](NewConsole.html) dialog.
* Tasks may be organized with folders. Delimit task name from folder name with "`::`". For example, type "`Shells::PowerShell`" instead of "`PowerShell`", and so on. Only one level of folders is allowed. No need to reorder tasks of one folder continuously, folders are filled by name. Generally this was implemented for drop-down <code class="plus">[+]</code> menu.
* Create default tasks with folders (Shells, Bash, SDK, and so on).
* Find task by name with or without folder part (Startup page).
* Button 'Add default tasks' will not create task duplicates (checking by task name).
* Use self-implemented UnExpandEnvStrings while creating default tasks.
* Allow switch '/reuse' in task parameters (alias for '/single' yet).



## Build 150203  {#Build_150203}

* [Issue 1886&nbsp;](http://github.com/Maximus5/conemu-old-issues/issues/1886): Change text cursor position with ‘LeftClick’ was not working when PSReadLine was loaded in your `$profile`. Look at `RevokeMouseInput.ps1`.
* github#20: ‘Ctrl-Left’ and ‘Ctrl-Right’ was not working in Vim/xterm.
* Create new console confirmation now if disabled by default. So ‘Win+W’ or ‘LClick’ on the <code class="plus">[+]</code> button creates new default task. The default task may be choosed in the ‘Tasks’ settings page. New console dialog (command, directory, as admin, and so on) may be shown with:
  * ‘Win+Shift+W’;
  * ‘Shift+LClick’, ‘RClick’ or ‘LongTap’ on the <code class="plus">[+]</code>;
  * ‘New console dialog...’ menu item (down arrow about <code class="plus">[+]</code>).
* Window and tab closing confirmations now are disabled by default. But if there are more than a two user processes running in the console - close confirmation may be shown. So, there are thee checkboxes now:
  * Confirm window closing (unchecked);
  * Confirm tab closing (unchecked);
  * When running process was detected (checked).

        GetInfo("PID"[,"HWND"[,...]])
        - Returns values of some ConEmu environment variables
          GetInfo("PID") returns %ConEmuPID% and so on
          It's processed in GUI so the result may differs from RealConsole

* Search field sometimes disappeared after playing with toolbar visibility.
* Add small gap between search field and right window frame edge if toolbar is hidden.
* HighlightAndGoto: Add examples with 'cmd.exe /c ...'.

        cmd.exe /c "echo Executing "%3" & "%3""
        
        After Ctrl+Click on highlighted (underlined) file
        ConEmu will start cmd.exe in new tab and highlighted file will be executed.
        Documents will be opened using associated application.
        Add "-new_console:n" suffix to suppress "Press Enter or Esc to close console".
