# Quake/Tilda style in ConEmu

ConEmu may pull down from the top of the screen
like gaming consoles do.

Quake style drop-down may be enabled/disabled on the
[Appearance](SettingsAppearance.html) Settings page.

There are some options for it like ‘Animation time’
or ‘Auto-hide on focus lose’.

And of course you may choose desired [global hotkey](GlobalHotKeys.html).
Look at [Keys & Macro](SettingsHotkeys.html) Settings page
and set one or both ‘Minimize/Restore ...’ hotkey.

Do you want to start ConEmu hidden?
Check out [ConEmu.exe command line switches](ConEmuArgs.html),
especially `/StartTSA`.
