# cmder

[cmder](http://cmder.net/) is a preconfigured software bundle
of [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) and some third-party software:

* [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/);
* [clink](TabCompletion.html#ConEmu_and_clink);
* [clink-completions](https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions);
* [PsGet module](https://github.com/psget/psget).

Also cmder changes some default ConEmu settings:

* ‘Monokai’ color scheme is default;
* [Default hotkeys](KeyboardShortcuts.html) were changed or removed;
* [cmd.exe prompt](CmdPrompt.html) was replaced with clink;
* [StatusBar](StatusBar.html) is not displayed, so you don't see important information;
* [TabBar](TabBar.html) is displayed at the bottom;
* cmder uses its own alias storage instead of [provided by ConEmu](SettingsEnvironment.html);
* cmder users do not see [default Tasks](Tasks.html) generated by ConEmu on first start.


## How to distinguish cmder from ConEmu

![cmder](/img/cmder.png)

cmder uses ConEmu as terminal, so the difference is the look
(which may be customized by user of course)
and presence of third-party software in the installation folder
(ConEmu is installed in `vendor\conemu-maximus5`).

But in most cases if you see color theme as on screenshot above
and the `λ` preceding your prompt, that is almost definitely the cmder.


## Summary

You may try this bundle if you don't like to have terminal configured precisely for you needs.

However, because cmder changes things, you may observe some problems which
do not exist in the official [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) distro.
