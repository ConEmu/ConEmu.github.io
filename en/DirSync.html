<p>DirSync is a Far Manager plugin that allows a user to synchronize the contents of two directories, much like &quot;Synchronize Folders&quot; function of Total Commander. It is heavily based on Advanced Compare plugin that comes with FAR, with several improvements: </p>
<p>- A progress is displayed for &quot;compare by content&quot; (useful if you compare large files on slow media, e.g. when verifying contents of DVDs) </p>
<p>- After a comparison is finished, a new editor is opened with a list of found differences. This is quite useful even if you don&#x27;t intend to do a synchronization, because - unlike Advanced Compare - it will display specific differences in subdirectories (A.C. only tells you that there is SOME difference SOMEWHERE in a subdirectory, but not what difference it is). </p>
<p>- You can edit the list of differences using all the power of FAR editor, including custom plugins such as Regular Expression Search and Replace. </p>
<p>- When the editor is closed, the plugin offers the synchronization. You can choose &quot;copy to left&quot; and &quot;copy to right&quot;, with &quot;confirm overwrite&quot; for each direction, or ESCape the dialog and perform no synchronization. Only lines that remained in the list at the time it was last saved will be processed. </p>
