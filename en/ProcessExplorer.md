# ProcessExplorer

[Process Explorer](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653)
is a handy and useful tool which can show you all about running processes
in your Windows system.

For example, it can show all environment variables defined in the selected
process - just open process properties and go to "Environment" tab.

Also, it can show all loaded dll-files in your process.

BTW, [Far Manager](FarManager.html) plugin ‘Process list’
can do same things.
