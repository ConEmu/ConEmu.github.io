<!-- Content starts -->

<p>Windows 7 and higher allows to pin application icons to the taskbar. You can pin ConEmu icon too, just run it, right-click taskbar icon and choose ‘Pin to taskbar’. </p>
<p>Right-clicking on that icon may pop up list of registered tasks. If you want to use that handy way to start tasks, do the following: </p>
<ul><li>goto ‘Tasks’ page of the Settings dialog and set up your favorites; </li>
<li>goto ‘Task bar’ page, check ‘Add ConEmu tasks to taskbar’ and press ‘Update Now!’ button. </li></ul>

<h2 id="h0"><a name="Failed_to_reuse"></a>Failed to reuse<a href="#Failed_to_reuse" class="section_anchor"></a></h2>
<p>Sometimes Windows explorer fails to reuse pinned icon. ConEmu can&#x27;t do anything with that, absolutely. This is internal feature of Microsoft, any application can&#x27;t tell to taskbar to ‘reuse’ icon, taskbar decides ‘to do or not to do’ itself. </p>
<p>Usual reasons for failing icon reuse are: </p>
<ul><li>User pin different executable than actually running. For example, pinned application is ‘...\KiTTYPortable.exe’, but actually running is ‘...\App\KiTTY\kitty_portable.exe’. That is not a ConEmu issue usually, user can (and must) pin ‘ConEmu.exe’ itself. </li>
<li>Bug in the Windows Explorer. Application can&#x27;t do anything with that. </li></ul><p>User may try to bypass reuse bug. How? There is no strict instructions. Try to un-pin and re-pin again. Try to logoff/logon. Try to run ConEmu from pinned icon, and when taskbar fails to reuse the icon, pin appeared new icon, and after that un-pin old icon. Contact Microsoft support? </p>
<p>At last, pinned shortcut list can&#x27;t be managed externally, but I believe they are located here: <code>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar</code>. </p>
