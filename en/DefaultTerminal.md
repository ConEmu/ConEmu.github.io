# How to change the default terminal emulator on Windows

In fact, Windows does not provide **official** way to change
the default terminal application.
That is because console subsystem is a part of Windows kernel
(`csrss.exe` up to Vista and `conhost.exe` in Windows 7 and higher).

Only use of hacking methods can ‘change’ default Windows terminal application.
And ConEmu can do it!

**WARNING**! Enabling ‘Default terminal’ feature may cause
[false alarms](FalseAlarms.html) in some antiviral programs.
However there were no issues about that yet.

And ConEmu from build 121124 introduced unique feature: ‘Replace default Windows terminal’.



## Description  {#Description}

[![ConEmu settings, Default Term page](/img/Settings-DefTerm.png)](SettingsDefTerm.html "ConEmu settings, Default Term page")
{% comment %} [Settings page description](SettingsDefTerm.html) {% endcomment %}

Just turn on checkbox ‘Force ConEmu as default terminal for console applications’,
optionally turn on checkbox ‘Register on OS startup’ and point ‘parent’ applications
from you like to start console tools (for example `explorer.exe|devenv.exe|totalcmd.exe`)
and voila.

You may press **Win**+**R** type `ipconfig /all` and press **Enter**.
It will starts in the new ConEmu tab.
And more, it will not unexpectedly disappear after `ipconfig` finishes
if ‘Confirm close’ option is set to ‘Automatic’ or ‘Always’.

When you run console application from specified ‘parent’ application,
your console application will be started in the new ConEmu tab.

The only exception - consoles started ‘As administrator’ can't be hooked yet.


**Note**! To ensure that your console application will be seized,
run ConEmu **before** starting your consoles or debugging processes
(from Visual Studio for example).
However, that may be not required if you choose ‘Register on OS startup’.
But in fact, ‘registering’ will affect, in most cases, only `explorer.exe` ‘parent’ process.
So, recommendation is ‘run ConEmu before...’

‘[Default terminal](SettingsDefTerm.html)’ feature is more powerful
than ‘Automatic attach of cmd’ (‘[ComSpec](SettingsComspec.html)’ page).
‘Default terminal’ can seize starting of **any** console program, not only cmd.exe.
For example, you may dblclick on `ipconfig.exe` in Total Commander panel and voila...
Also there will be no flickering of real console window.

Settings page docs: [Default term](SettingsDefTerm.html).



## Force some application within standard terminal  {#force-standard-terminal}

If You need to run some [console application](ConsoleApplication.html)
in the standard Windows console there is no need to disable
‘Default terminal’ feature completely, just use [-new_console:z](NewConsole.html) switch.
For example, run from `Win+R`:

~~~
cmd -new_console:z
~~~



## Tech info  {#Tech_info}

The only real way to ‘change’ default Windows terminal:

* Hide [RealConsole](RealConsole.html) when your console application is to be started;
* Run new ConEmu window if no one instance was running before;
* Attach started console application into ConEmu instance.

Looks simple, right? But who can perform these actions?



### Hooks must be installed   {#Hooks_must_be_installed}

[ConEmuHk](ConEmuHk.html) (`ConEmuHk.dll` or `ConEmuHk64.dll`) must be loaded
into process space of ‘parent’ application **from** which you are starting
new console application: Explorer (explorer.exe), Task manager (taskmgr.exe),
Visual Studio (devenv.exe or WDExpress.exe), and so on...

When [ConEmuHk](ConEmuHk.html) is loaded into ‘parent’ application it will hook
limited set of Windows API functions related to creating new processes.
So, when you start console application from shortcut, **Win**+**R** or even
from Visual Studio debugger, [ConEmuHk](ConEmuHk.html) will change application
startup procedure to the described above.

Actually, startup procedure slightly differs when you start debugging session.



### Normal console application startup   {#Normal_console_application_startup}

To avoid flickering of [RealConsole](RealConsole.html) window
[ConEmuHk](ConEmuHk.html) will change command line.

When you run "cmd" from **Win**+**R** and no ConEmu instance was runned:

~~~
ConEmu.exe /single /cmd -new_console:n "C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"
~~~

And when ConEmu window already exists:

~~~
ConEmuC64.exe [many internal switched] /HIDE /NOCONFIRM /ROOT "C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"
~~~

That is safe because ‘parent’ does not really need to get started process handle (`cmd.exe` in example).


### Starting debugging session   {#Starting_debugging_session}

When you start Visual Studio debugger of your `ConAppSample`,
‘parent’ process (devenv.exe or WDExpress.exe) need to get
the handle of your `ConAppSample.exe` to be able to call
debugging routines.

That is why [RealConsole](RealConsole.html) window will flicker
on screen before alternative attach procedure completes.

Note, when you are debugging .Net console application,
Visual Studio will run `ConAppSample.vshost.exe`,
if option ‘Enable the Visual Studio hosting process’
is checked in your project Properties\Debug.
