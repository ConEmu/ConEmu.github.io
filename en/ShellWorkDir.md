# About directories

When you run new console the shell is starting in the directory you specified.
That is the ‘**Startup directory**’.

![ConEmu new console](/img/ConEmuCreate.png "ConEmu confirmation of new console creation")

When you work with shell and do some CD's or run your scripts,
its ‘**Current directory**’ may (and will) be changed.

But directory is changed inside your
[Shell](TerminalVsShell.html) but not inside terminal.
ConEmu does not handle your shell commands when your execute them.
Moreover, some shells (PowerShell, bash, etc.) don't even call
[Window API](WinApi.html) function ‘**SetCurrentDirectory**’,
they handle their working directories internally.

However, since ConEmu's build 140818 you got full support of ‘**Current directory**’ (**CD**).

* Automatic detection of **CD** in `cmd.exe` or `tcc.exe`;
* Ability to inform ConEmu GUI about shell's **CD** using
  [ANSI](AnsiEscapeCodes.html) or [ConEmuC](ConEmuC.html);
* Display **CD** in the tab title using
  [tab templates](SettingsTabBar.html);
* Reuse **CD** in the [Restart](RestartTab.html) and
  [Create new console](LaunchNewTab.html) dialogs;
* At last you may use `%CD%` variable with [Shell](GuiMacro.html#List_of_functions)
  macro function in the `Dir` parameter.
  
But user has to [configure shells they are using](What_you_shall_do_to_get_CD_support).

* [PowerShell](#PowerShell)

Just enable [Inject ConEmuHk](ConEmuHk.html) feature.
ConEmu will maintain **CD** for you automatically.


<h3 id="bash_and_other_cygwin_shells"> bash and other cygwin shells </h3>

You need to tell bash to run `ConEmuC -StoreCWD` command
each time its prompt executed.
For example, add to your `.bashrc`

~~~
PROMPT_COMMAND='ConEmuC -StoreCWD'
~~~

<h3 id="zsh"> zsh </h3>

~~~
prmptcmd() { eval "$PROMPT_COMMAND" }
precmd_functions=(prmptcmd)
PROMPT_COMMAND='ConEmuC -StoreCWD'
~~~

<h3 id="PowerShell"> PowerShell </h3>

You need to modify your profile to override prompt function. Just run in your PowerShell prompt:

~~~
notepad $Profile
~~~

And change prompt as in the following example:

~~~
function prompt {
  # Just prettify the prompt
  Write-Host -NoNewline -ForegroundColor Cyan "PS "
  $dir = $(get-location).ProviderPath
  Write-Host -NoNewline -ForegroundColor Yellow $dir
  # You may use ANSI or direct ConEmuC call
  # Write-Host -NoNewline (([char]27) + "]9;9;`"" + $dir + "`"" + ([char]27) + "\")
  & ConEmuC -StoreCWD "$dir"
  return ">"
}
~~~
