# VirtualConsole

In turn to [RealConsole](RealConsole.html), ‘Virtual console’ is just a part
of ConEmu window where ConEmu draw the contents of your terminal.

That's why its appearance is [fully configurable](Settings.html).
Well, with the only exception of [ChildGui](ChildGui.html),
when contents is drawn by child process and is not configurable
by ConEmu.
