# Restart one of ConEmu's consoles

You run [consoles](ConsoleApplication.md) in [tabs](TabBar.md) or [panes](SplitScreen.html),
and if you need to rerun (recreate) active console you may do this
by hotkey (default is `Win`+`~` and you may choose any on [Keys & Macro page](SettingsHotkeys.md))
or from [tab popup menu](TabMenu.html) by ‘Restart...’ menu item.

If you don't have [tab bar](TabBar.html) visible,
there are [other ways](TabMenu.html) to call tab's menu.

Also, you may restart console without comfirmation dialog from tab popup menu:
‘Restart’ and ‘Restart as Admin’ menu items.

This feature allows to reuse root command,
for example restart your project compilation (on some build errors)
or close (‘Terminate’ button in Restart dialog) active console.
